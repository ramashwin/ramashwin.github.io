abstract = {In order to satisfy users’ information needs while incurring minimum interference to their ongoing activities, previous studies have proposed using Optical Head-mounted Displays (OHMDs) with different input techniques. However, it is unclear how these techniques compare against one another in terms of being comfortable and non-intrusive to a user's everyday tasks. Through a wizard-of-oz study, we thus compared four subtle interaction techniques (feet, arms, thumb-index-fingers, and teeth) in three daily hands-busy tasks under different settings (giving a presentation–sitting, carrying bags–walking, and folding clothes–standing). We found that while each interaction technique has its niche, thumb-index-finger interaction has the best overall balance and is most preferred as a cross-scenario subtle interaction technique for smart glasses. We provide further evaluation of thumb-index-finger interaction with an in-the-wild study with 8 users. Our results contribute to an enhanced understanding of user preferences for subtle interaction techniques with smart glasses for everyday use.},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of mobile phones allows video content to be watched on the go. However,
	users' current on-the-go video learning experience on phones is encumbered by issues
	of toggling and managing attention between the video and surroundings, as informed
	by our initial qualitative study. To alleviate this, we explore how combining the
	emergent smart glasses (Optical Head-Mounted Display or OHMD) platform with a redesigned
	video presentation style can better distribute users' attention between learning and
	walking tasks. We evaluated three presentation techniques: highlighting, sequentiality,
	and data persistence to find that combining sequentiality and data persistence is
	highly effective, yielding a 56% higher immediate recall score compared to a static
	video presentation. We also compared the OHMD against smartphones to delineate the
	advantages of either platform for on-the-go video learning in the context of everyday
	mobility tasks. We found that OHMDs improved users' 7-day delayed recall scores by
	17% while still allowing 5.6% faster walking speed, especially during complex mobility
	tasks. Based on the findings, we introduce Layered Serial Visual Presentation (LSVP)
	style, which incorporates sequentiality, strict data persistence, and transparent
	background, among other properties, for future OHMD-based on-the-go video learning.},
